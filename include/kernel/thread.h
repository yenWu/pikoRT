 * This stackframe is built to handle the first scheduling of a task on

 *
 * Stage 1:
 *   After switch_to() has switched the interrupt stacks for current and
 *   next tasks the function will restore the kernel-context for the next
 *   thread. That context is the non-scratch registers r4 to r11. At this
 *   point we don't care about the values in these registers: they are
 *   not used after that point during in that interrupt, and the next
 *   interrupt context will reinitilized them should it need to.
 *
 * Stage 2:
 *   After restoring the non-scratch registers we return from switch_to()
 *   and the value loaded in LR in stage1 is the address of task_kickstart().
 *   This function is a trampoline that emulate a return 'from interrupt
 *   sequence' by restoring the non-scratch registers for the tasks as
 *   well as triggering a switch from Handler_Mode to Thread_Mode in the
 *   CPU. We initialize the task non-scratch registers to 0.
